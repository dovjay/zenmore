If you play **Genshin Impact** then you would expect that this game must have some kind of reaction mechanism. 
The answer is they have it, but not in the way Genshin works. At least from the latest turing test.

## Attack & Element Types

Characters are separated into 3 types of attacks:
1. **Slashes** (Swords)
2. **Strikes** (Blunt/Heavy attack like kicks, hammer, etc)
3. **Pierces** (Gun)

In addition, there are also 5 types of elements:
1. Electric
2. Fire
3. Ice
4. Wind
5. Physical

Character of each attack type (not the elements) gain a **higher Stagger multiplier** when attacking specific enemies. 
The Stagger Multiplier buff is indicated by the icon **'Boost'** above the enemies' Stagger bar.

## Enemy Types
There are 3 types of enemies for now, and each of them has their own weakness:
