  Please bear in mind that this is only a beta result. **Might not represent** the final quality.
</p>

All character have the same movement set (Basic, Special Attack, Ultimate) but each with unique skill.
Overall the controls are not that different from Genshin Impact. So you don't have to learn anything from scratch.

## Stagger

The core mechanic in ZZZ. Below the enemy's HP bar, you can see the Stagger bar. 
Once you accumulate to 100%, the enemy will be stunned and unable to take action.

You can do combo attack if you use heavy attack on staggered enemies.
When you stagger enemies, you will also deal extra damage.

<img className="mx-auto rounded-lg" src="/images/posts/stagger-bar.png" alt="Stagger Bar" />

That 81 means the stagger bar is already at 81%. \
That Boost symbol means that your character's attack type is the enemy's weakness point. \
Boost basically will help you increase the stagger bar faster.

<img className="mx-auto rounded-lg" src="/images/posts/staggered-enemy.png" alt="Staggered Enemy" />

When you see DMG 250%, that means that the enemy will get extra damage because you already staggered them. \
Once the bar reached 100, it will slowly depleted to 0. \
So during this time, it's better to hit the staggered enemies instead of the healthy enemies.
