  Please bear in mind that this is only a beta result. **Might not represent** the final quality.
</p>

All character have the same movement set (Basic, Special Attack, Ultimate) but each with unique skill.
Overall the controls are not that different from Genshin Impact. So you don't have to learn anything from scratch.
