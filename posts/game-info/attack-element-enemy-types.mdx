If you play **Genshin Impact** then you would expect that this game must have some kind of reaction mechanism. 
The answer is they have it, but not in the way Genshin works. At least from the latest turing test.

## Attack & Element Types

Characters are separated into 3 types of attacks:
1. **Slashes** (Swords)
2. **Strikes** (Blunt/Heavy attack like kicks, hammer, etc)
3. **Pierces** (Gun)

In addition, there are also 5 types of elements:
1. Electric
2. Fire
3. Ice
4. Wind
5. Physical

These elements are not strong against specific elements yet. \
In the CBT1, these elements will apply specific effects instead.

Fire = Burn (Damage Over Time) \
Ice = Frozen (stun) \
Lightning = Need more info \
Wind = Need more info

## Enemy Types
There are 3 types of enemies for now, and each of them has their own weakness:

### 1. Ethereals (weak against **Slashes**)
